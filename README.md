# Arduino Space Invaders (formerly Game Thing 2.0)

> A version of the famous Space Invaders that runs on an Arduino

This is the repository for our take on Space Invaders running on an Arduino Due (SAM3X8E). While not all features are present, the final version of the  game can play music while running the game, generates new levels randomnly, increases difficulty as you progress, saves high scores, keeps track of lives and can measure acurrately the userâ€™s
accuracy while playing. This project utilizes a complex finite state machine (FSM) as the main game engine. It is constantly updating the screen as well as all the other variables. Further improvements can be done with the use of a display with a faster refresh rate.
